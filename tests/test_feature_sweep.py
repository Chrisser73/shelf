"""The render census: a turned-off feature leaves no use-control on a page
that stays on.

The page-level counterpart of the registry lint in tests/test_features.py.
That lint proves every route a feature owns is gated; this one proves the
pages that stay on stop *offering* those routes once the feature is off.

A feature's gated URLs are derived from the route census, never listed here:
every route whose dependencies carry its `feature_key`, plus its `inline`
routes. Its JS-only references come from the registry's `client` names,
because the URLs a script fetches never appear in the rendered HTML.

Both halves are needed (G108). The negative half alone would pass on a seed
that never rendered the control; the positive half's `SWEPT` equality fails
both on a new unguarded control and on a seed that stopped exercising one.
