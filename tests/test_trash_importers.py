"""CSV import restores a trashed dedup hit instead of shadowing it.

T11 of the soft-delete-collisions plan. `app/routers/items_csv.py`'s two
dedup reads (ISBN and the title/author fallback) already read the physical
`items` table, so a trashed row was found as `existing` and then treated as
a live hit: skip mode reported "skipped" while the row sat invisibly in
Trash, and update mode wrote metadata to a row nobody could see. Neither
mode restored it.

Now:

- a trashed hit is restored before anything else about the row is decided,
  in both skip and update mode (G85 — the restore is the row's first write);
- a live row always wins over a trashed one sharing the same dedup key
  (claude-R4, "live wins") — both reads carry `ORDER BY deleted_at IS NOT
  NULL, id LIMIT 1`, so a trashed row is only acted on when no live row
  matches.
