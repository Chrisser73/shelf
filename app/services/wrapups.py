"""Period parsing and summary data for the wrap-up preview.

`stats()` (app/routers/pages.py:446-535) is the source of truth for what
"finished" and "top author" mean in this app — this module reproduces those
same predicates, bounded to one month or one year instead of "all time" /
"this calendar year", so a wrap-up can never disagree with /stats:

- finished: ``reading_status = 'read' AND date_finished IS NOT NULL``
  (pages.py:481), same for every media type — the verb (read/watch/play)
  comes from `status_labels(media_type)`, not a second predicate.
- top author: the first entry of the comma-joined `authors` string
  (pages.py:530), counted here over the period's finished items, or over
  the period's additions when nothing was finished.

Every query here reads `items_live`, never `items` (G105) — a trashed item
must never appear in a count or a tile. Every function takes the caller's
already-open connection; nothing here opens its own `get_db()` (G112).
