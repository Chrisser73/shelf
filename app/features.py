"""Feature registry and per-feature on/off flags.

A feature is an optional part of Shelf an admin can turn off: its nav tab, its
routes, its scan modes and its background job. Core surfaces (scan, Browse,
items, locations, tags, Trash, settings, auth, backup, logs) are never
registered and cannot be turned off.

**Flags gate surfaces and schedulers, never schema and never data.** Every
table exists whatever the flags say; disabling hides and refuses, enabling
re-reveals everything, including rows written while the feature was off.

Each flag is one `settings` row, `feature.<key>`. Only the exact value "0"
disables a feature: an absent row (every upgraded install) or any other value
means enabled, so an upgrade changes nothing until an admin turns something
off. Flags are rows only; no env var overrides them. A new install writes all
fifteen rows explicitly, from the profile chosen at setup; an upgraded
install has none, and reads as Everything.

`nav.py` imports this module, never the reverse at module level.
